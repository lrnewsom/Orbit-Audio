## Headline

**OrbitAudio — Real-time 3D/8D spatializer for macOS**

---

## Short description

OrbitAudio is a macOS menu bar app that applies binaural-style spatialization to stereo audio in real time. It uses interaural time difference (ITD) and head-shadow filtering so sound feels like it’s coming from a direction, with optional orbit modes for 3D/8D-style motion. Built for low latency, it fits into a DAW or system-audio pipeline (e.g. with BlackHole). Best experienced with headphones.
